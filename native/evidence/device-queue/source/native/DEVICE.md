# Registered Cycles device and wavefront queue

The new `native/cycles` implementation registers `DEVICE_WEBGPU` with the
original Cycles device factory and implements `DeviceQueue`. The Linux gate
passes against the unchanged CodeBrix.WebGpu.Native package. This connects
scene storage and scheduler control to WebGPU; camera, intersection and shading
dispatches are still pending in this device. It does not yet render through a
complete Cycles session. The earlier [snapshot renderer](README.md) remains
the separate, working image reference on Linux and Android.

## What is implemented

`Scene::device_update` runs directly against `WebGPUDevice`. Native Cycles
builds the BVH and SVM programs and uploads its original device tables. The
backend keeps their raw layouts, including `KernelData`, and assigns virtual
byte addresses to `device_ptr` values. Scene data is no longer prepared on a
CPU device for this test. Scene preparation itself remains native host work,
as it does with other Cycles GPU devices.

The first allocator uses one WebGPU storage-buffer arena with 16-byte aligned
allocations, coalescing free ranges, stable virtual addresses and GPU-to-GPU
growth copies. Zero/copy/readback operations respect queue order. It is bounded
by the device's single storage-binding limit; paging or multiple arenas will
be needed before claiming large-scene support. This is not a performance gate.

The original `PathTraceWork::create` selects `PathTraceWorkGPU` for this device.
The original GPU scheduler allocates its native structure-of-arrays state,
uploads `IntegratorStateGPU`, queues reset and reads its queue counters through
the new backend. No CPU rendering or alternate scheduler stands in for these
operations.

Twelve scheduler kernels have WGSL implementations:

- Reset both main and shadow path queues.
- Select queued main/shadow paths, active main paths, terminated main/shadow
  paths, and main/shadow paths needing compaction.
- Compute shader-count prefix sums and select sorted paths with deferred work
  when a dispatch limit is reached.
- Compact main and shadow states.

WGSL's 32-bit atomic storage also carries Cycles' 8-bit and 16-bit fields.
Masked atomic updates prevent adjacent state writes from overwriting each
other. State-copy descriptors come from the original state templates and native
`sizeof` values; all allocated fields are copied, including vector payloads
and array members. MNEE's cross-path ownership repair is explicitly rejected
until implemented.

## Evidence

The [Linux report](evidence/device-queue/linux-x64/validation.json) records:

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Device discovery, type names and factory creation | Pass |
| Original GPU path-work selection, allocation and reset | Pass |
| Original scene tables uploaded and read back unchanged | 11 |
| Reset sizes, including zero and partial workgroups | 7 |
| Path-selection modes, membership/counts and guards | 7 |
| Sorting limits, including zero and partial buckets | 6 |
| Main and shadow compaction versus original helpers | 2 |
| Native state fields / state slots exercised | 123 / 4,099 |
| Invalid inputs, unsupported MNEE and invalid GPU sort key | 7 rejected |
| Unimplemented camera dispatch | Explicit error |
| Cycles allocation accounting after cleanup | Zero bytes |

The prefix-sum and sorted-index references execute the original upstream
helpers. State compaction executes the untouched original state-copy/move
function bodies using host arrays, with MNEE disabled in that oracle. Every
byte of every tested state field is compared, including untouched guards.
Selection membership is compared exactly; atomic reservations may produce a
different valid order within a shader bucket, so sorting verifies bucket
membership, unique indices, counts, deferred counters and output guards.

Additional tests force arena growth after a queued GPU write and verify its
result at the same virtual address. They check range reuse, a host upload
following a pending kernel, and an unaligned partial-byte readback. A bad sort
key reaches the GPU check and is reported through the queue's status word.

The main gate made 30 compute dispatches. Its numerous host transfers inspect
individual fields for correctness; their counts are not a production workload
or a throughput measurement. Only Linux x64/Intel Vulkan has executed this
new registered-device gate. The previous four-device image evidence remains
valid for the snapshot renderer, not for these new scheduler kernels.

## Build and reproduce

Use the pinned source/dependency setup from the prototype instructions, then:

```sh
python3 native/tools/device_gate.py run
python3 native/tests/test_webgpu_audit.py
```

The build uses a separate CMake directory, `native/work/cycles-build`. A
generated overlay changes three upstream files: the device enumeration,
factory/discovery functions and report name. The reference checkout remains
clean. The exact patch, generated files, compiler commands, source snapshots,
reference helpers, package audit and results are saved in
`evidence/device-queue`; `device_gate.py archive` creates this checkpoint once
and refuses to overwrite it. No native dependency binaries are archived.

The package remains `CodeBrix.WebGpu.Native.MitLicenseForever` 1.0.290.1433.
During this gate the sibling repository received an external documentation
change in `include/codebrix_wgpu_procs.rs`: an updated Rust inclusion example.
All nine native binaries and every C header still match the NuGet archive and
cache. The new builder explicitly permits only whole-line comment differences
in that unused Rust helper; it records both hashes and the exception. Package
cache bytes must still match the archive exactly. Rust code, C-header and
native-binary differences still reject the build; six audit tests verify these
boundaries. Earlier builders retain their strict all-files identity check.

## Next integration

The wavefront queue now needs the actual camera, intersection, surface/light
and shadow entry points operating on Cycles' native state and scene tables.
The existing WGSL rendering functions provide tested behavior to adapt, but
the existing complete-path shader must not be disguised as those individual
kernels. Queue transitions, counters, shadow-path creation, film writes and
compaction need end-to-end comparison through the original scheduler.

Full session rendering, texture bindings, other GPU platforms, large scenes,
shared-device handoff and final NuGet/RID packaging remain unfinished. All
unimplemented kernel IDs currently produce a named error rather than a
fallback render. Full rendering parity remains the objective.
