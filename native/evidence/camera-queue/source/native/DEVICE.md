# Registered Cycles device and wavefront queue

The new `native/cycles` implementation registers `DEVICE_WEBGPU` with the
original Cycles device factory and implements `DeviceQueue`. The Linux gate
passes against the unchanged CodeBrix.WebGpu.Native package. This connects
scene storage, scheduler control and a limited camera entry point to WebGPU.
Intersection and shading dispatches are still pending in this device. It does not yet render through a
complete Cycles session. The earlier [snapshot renderer](README.md) remains
the separate, working image reference on Linux and Android.

## What is implemented

`Scene::device_update` runs directly against `WebGPUDevice`. Native Cycles
builds the BVH and SVM programs and uploads its original device tables. The
backend keeps their raw layouts, including `KernelData`, and assigns virtual
byte addresses to `device_ptr` values. Scene data is no longer prepared on a
CPU device for this test. Scene preparation itself remains native host work,
as it does with other Cycles GPU devices.

The first allocator uses one WebGPU storage-buffer arena with 16-byte aligned
allocations, coalescing free ranges, stable virtual addresses and GPU-to-GPU
growth copies. Zero/copy/readback operations respect queue order. It is bounded
by the device's single storage-binding limit; paging or multiple arenas will
be needed before claiming large-scene support. This is not a performance gate.

The original `PathTraceWork::create` selects `PathTraceWorkGPU` for this device.
The original GPU scheduler allocates its native structure-of-arrays state,
uploads `IntegratorStateGPU`, queues reset and reads its queue counters through
the new backend. No CPU rendering or alternate scheduler stands in for these
operations.

Twelve scheduler kernels have WGSL implementations:

- Reset both main and shadow path queues.
- Select queued main/shadow paths, active main paths, terminated main/shadow
  paths, and main/shadow paths needing compaction.
- Compute shader-count prefix sums and select sorted paths with deferred work
  when a dispatch limit is reached.
- Compact main and shadow states.

WGSL's 32-bit atomic storage also carries Cycles' 8-bit and 16-bit fields.
Masked atomic updates prevent adjacent state writes from overwriting each
other. State-copy descriptors come from the original state templates and native
`sizeof` values; all allocated fields are copied, including vector payloads
and array members. MNEE's cross-path ownership repair is explicitly rejected
until implemented.

## Control checkpoint

The [Linux report](evidence/device-queue/linux-x64/validation.json) records:

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Device discovery, type names and factory creation | Pass |
| Original GPU path-work selection, allocation and reset | Pass |
| Original scene tables uploaded and read back unchanged | 11 |
| Reset sizes, including zero and partial workgroups | 7 |
| Path-selection modes, membership/counts and guards | 7 |
| Sorting limits, including zero and partial buckets | 6 |
| Main and shadow compaction versus original helpers | 2 |
| Native state fields / state slots exercised | 123 / 4,099 |
| Invalid inputs, unsupported MNEE and invalid GPU sort key | 7 rejected |
| Camera dispatch at this earlier checkpoint | Explicit error; implemented below in the next checkpoint |
| Cycles allocation accounting after cleanup | Zero bytes |

The prefix-sum and sorted-index references execute the original upstream
helpers. State compaction executes the untouched original state-copy/move
function bodies using host arrays, with MNEE disabled in that oracle. Every
byte of every tested state field is compared, including untouched guards.
Selection membership is compared exactly; atomic reservations may produce a
different valid order within a shader bucket, so sorting verifies bucket
membership, unique indices, counts, deferred counters and output guards.

Additional tests force arena growth after a queued GPU write and verify its
result at the same virtual address. They check range reuse, a host upload
following a pending kernel, and an unaligned partial-byte readback. A bad sort
key reaches the GPU check and is reported through the queue's status word.

The main gate made 30 compute dispatches. Its numerous host transfers inspect
individual fields for correctness; their counts are not a production workload
or a throughput measurement. Only Linux x64/Intel Vulkan has executed this
new registered-device gate. The previous four-device image evidence remains
valid for the snapshot renderer, not for these new scheduler kernels.

## Camera entry through the original scheduler

`DEVICE_KERNEL_INTEGRATOR_INIT_FROM_CAMERA` now runs WGSL against the original
native `KernelData`, sampler/filter tables and `IntegratorStateGPU` arrays.
The original scheduler's `enqueue_work_tiles` uploads the actual work tiles,
dispatches the camera entry, reads the queue counters, and selects
`INTERSECT_CLOSEST` next. No CPU-prepared per-path rays or replacement scheduler
are involved. Native `offsetof`/`sizeof` values generate the WGSL layout
constants for the current ABI.

This entry implements static perspective pinhole rays, tabulated Sobol, pixel
filter or explicit jitter, clipping, compact ray differentials, path state
initialization and the queue transition. It also implements atomic film sample
reservation, the existing adaptive-pixel skip flag, and indexed camera retries.
Other camera modes, motion/depth of field and optional initialization features
(volumes, guiding, denoising, light linking and portals) are explicitly rejected.
Reading adaptive skip flags is not a complete adaptive-sampling implementation.

The [camera report](evidence/camera-queue/linux-x64/validation.json) records:

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Configurations, covering four scrambling distances and both work orderings | 24 |
| Initialized paths across multi-tile dispatches | 22,972 |
| Indexed retry paths and queue-counter transitions | 65 |
| Integer/state/guard comparisons | 3,422,188 |
| Floating-point comparisons | 254,276 |
| Untouched state bytes checked | 11,734,032 |
| Unsupported configurations, invalid film/pointers/tiles/indices | 12 rejected |
| Original scheduler selects closest intersection next | Pass |
| Cycles allocation accounting after cleanup | Zero bytes |

The reference executes the unchanged original CPU camera, path initialization
and film functions on the same prepared scene data. All non-ray state and film
bytes must match exactly. Atomic sample assignment can reorder samples among
lanes: the test first proves one-to-one membership in the independently computed
CPU `(pixel, sample)` set, then compares every resulting state. Untouched slots
and skipped pixels retain their expected bytes.

Ray checks retain the earlier camera tolerance, `5e-5 + 2e-4 * abs(reference)`.
Maximum absolute errors were `9.53674e-7` for position/direction/time/minimum
distance, `6.70552e-8` for compact differentials, and `0.000244141` for maximum
distance (the fixture uses a 1,000-unit clip length). The separate strict
`1e-7 + 1e-7 * abs(reference)` comparison reports **7,668 failing components**;
strict numerical parity has not passed. These are retained in the evidence,
not excluded or hidden by a changed tolerance.

The twelve scheduler-control kernels and six package-audit tests also pass with
this expanded backend. Their rerun is saved alongside the camera evidence. The
control gate now uses the still-unimplemented intersection entry to verify
unsupported dispatch rejection. This integrated camera gate has run only on
Linux x64/Intel Vulkan; it does not establish Android or Metal camera parity.

## Build and reproduce

Use the pinned source/dependency setup from the prototype instructions, then:

```sh
python3 native/tools/device_gate.py run
python3 native/tools/camera_queue_gate.py run
python3 native/tests/test_webgpu_audit.py
```

The build uses a separate CMake directory, `native/work/cycles-build`. A
generated overlay changes three upstream files: the device enumeration,
factory/discovery functions and report name. The reference checkout remains
clean. The exact patch, generated files, compiler commands, source snapshots,
reference helpers, package audit and results are saved in
`evidence/device-queue`; `device_gate.py archive` creates this checkpoint once
and refuses to overwrite it. No native dependency binaries are archived.
The camera runner also rebuilds and reruns the control gate. Its separate
`camera_queue_gate.py archive` checkpoint is `evidence/camera-queue`, with source
hashes, original reference headers, compiler commands, runtime identity and
both test reports. It also refuses to overwrite an existing checkpoint.

The package remains `CodeBrix.WebGpu.Native.MitLicenseForever` 1.0.290.1433.
During this gate the sibling repository received an external documentation
change in `include/codebrix_wgpu_procs.rs`: an updated Rust inclusion example.
All nine native binaries and every C header still match the NuGet archive and
cache. The new builder explicitly permits only whole-line comment differences
in that unused Rust helper; it records both hashes and the exception. Package
cache bytes must still match the archive exactly. Rust code, C-header and
native-binary differences still reject the build; six audit tests verify these
boundaries. Earlier builders retain their strict all-files identity check.

## Next integration

The wavefront queue now needs intersection, surface/light and shadow entry
points operating on Cycles' native state and scene tables, followed by full
film output through the original scheduler. The camera's initial queue
transition is connected; its remaining modes still need implementation.
The existing WGSL rendering functions provide tested behavior to adapt, but
the existing complete-path shader must not be disguised as those individual
kernels. Queue transitions, counters, shadow-path creation, film writes and
compaction need end-to-end comparison through the original scheduler.

Full session rendering, texture bindings, other GPU platforms, large scenes,
shared-device handoff and final NuGet/RID packaging remain unfinished. All
unimplemented kernel IDs currently produce a named error rather than a
fallback render. Full rendering parity remains the objective.
